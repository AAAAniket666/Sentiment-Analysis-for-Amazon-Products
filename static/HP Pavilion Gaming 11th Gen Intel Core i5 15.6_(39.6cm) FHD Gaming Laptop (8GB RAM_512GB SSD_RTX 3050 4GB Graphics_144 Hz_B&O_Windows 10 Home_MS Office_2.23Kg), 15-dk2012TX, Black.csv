Best for students and Average gaming.,,"Performance: 4.4/5
Apperance: 4.7/5
Quality: 4.5/5
Battery life: 4.1/5

Overall best in price if you want to get a average gaming and productive life you can buy this piece of quality build laptop for your work and fun."
It is the best laptop for gaming under this range,,It's performance is just awesome. Appearance not so good.
Got a core i7 processor laptop!,,"On the Amazon product details it is mentioned that it has core i5 11th gen laptop. But I received a laptop having a core i7 11th gen processor! And that's amazing. But one downside is that it's a Windows 11 laptop. I wanted a windows 10 laptop because, windows 11 doesn't support some cracked games. That's why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5. So far the laptop is working very fine and no problems faced."
Excellent,,Looks awesome.very fast.
"Wifi speed very low, hp ni thop anukunta me karmaüò§",,Wifi signale received very poor
Not so good afterall,,"Overall performance is average. The display is not that great doesn't matter if gaming is the priority. Not made for color grading. I received one with a screen bleeding issue. The keyboard is very nice though with a soft touch. 8 GB RAM is not enough. The purple backlit keyboard is just the worst. Also, the laptop is much heavier than expected. The Graphics card's performance is good with great thermal management hence the poor battery backup. Performance is quite better than I expected. Also, the 200-watt power adapter is insane. The hinge design is new but not reliable it's a little bit delicate."
