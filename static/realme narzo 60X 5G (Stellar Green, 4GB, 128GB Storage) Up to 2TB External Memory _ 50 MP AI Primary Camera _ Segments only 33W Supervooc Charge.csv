Decent buy if you are a normal user,,"If you're looking for a smartphone for day-to-day tasks like browsing the web, scrolling through social media, and watching movies, then this phone is for you.

Pros:

1.Display:

I'm really surprised by its display. It offers a 120 Hz refresh rate and supports 1080p resolution. When watching a movie, it gives you an immersive experience.

2.Sound:

The mono speaker offers very good sound quality. The 'real sound technology' in this phone is very useful for watching movies and listening to music.

2.Heating Issue:

Even with normal use, the phone occasionally gets hot. Sometimes, you can literally fry an egg using the backside of this phone.

3.Front Camera:

Decent buy if you are a normal user,,"If you're looking for a smartphone for day-to-day tasks like browsing the web, scrolling through social media, and watching movies, then this phone is for you.

Pros:

1.Display:

I'm really surprised by its display. It offers a 120 Hz refresh rate and supports 1080p resolution. When watching a movie, it gives you an immersive experience.

2.Sound:

The mono speaker offers very good sound quality. The 'real sound technology' in this phone is very useful for watching movies and listening to music.

3.Battery:

The 5000mAh battery and 33W charger are sufficient. For normal users, the battery gives about 10 hours of screen-on time (SOT).

4.Network:

5G and 4G work really well. I haven't faced any problems related to network speed or range issues.

Cons:

1.Processor:

This phone uses a very outdated processor. When you try games like BGMI or Free Fire, the phone will start to heat up. Also, when you play for 1 hour or more, there are issues with frame drops, and the game gets laggy.

2.Heating Issue:

Even with normal use, the phone occasionally gets hot. Sometimes, you can literally fry an egg using the backside of this phone.

3.Front Camera:

Horrible front camera performance. It doesn't offer the quality of even a below 10K budget phone. The rear camera is decent.

Decent buy if you are a normal user,,"If you're looking for a smartphone for day-to-day tasks like browsing the web, scrolling through social media, and watching movies, then this phone is for you.

Pros:

1.Display:

I'm really surprised by its display. It offers a 120 Hz refresh rate and supports 1080p resolution. When watching a movie, it gives you an immersive experience.

2.Sound:

The mono speaker offers very good sound quality. The 'real sound technology' in this phone is very useful for watching movies and listening to music.

3.Battery:

The 5000mAh battery and 33W charger are sufficient. For normal users, the battery gives about 10 hours of screen-on time (SOT).

4.Network:

5G and 4G work really well. I haven't faced any problems related to network speed or range issues.

Cons:

1.Processor:

This phone uses a very outdated processor. When you try games like BGMI or Free Fire, the phone will start to heat up. Also, when you play for 1 hour or more, there are issues with frame drops, and the game gets laggy.

2.Heating Issue:

Even with normal use, the phone occasionally gets hot. Sometimes, you can literally fry an egg using the backside of this phone.

3.Front Camera:

Horrible front camera performance. It doesn't offer the quality of even a below 10K budget phone. The rear camera is decent.
