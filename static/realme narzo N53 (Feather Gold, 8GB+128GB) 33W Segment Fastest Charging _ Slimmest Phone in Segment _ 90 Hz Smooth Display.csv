Love the phone but missing couple of basic feature options,,"For the price of 8999 this is truly an amazing phone in terms of performance, smoothness weight and comfortability to use. I exchanged this with a Redmi 9A and compared to that this device is 100 times better.
The camera is amazing, battery backup is fantastic and charging is super fast. There are no lags when switching apps and there are many useful features which are seen in Moto phones that I could find on this device.

Having said that I was surprised to find some basic features missing or complicated compared to Samsung or Redmi phones.
- There is no option to Hide Apps. No App Lock or any such option to hide the many apps which you may not use. The UI version is T edition and that is not even mentioned on the website. The previous UI versions and the option to enable Hide Apps or Lock Apps is listed on Realme website. I use the feature of Hide Apps on all my phones and so it was a disappointment here. Call to customer care did not get a confirmation if that will be available in future updates.
- There is no option to create folder or group icons together. In all my other phones I have this option and even on the cheaper that Realme ones. For example all your UPI apps will be mixed up all over the app drawer and cannot be grouped under a single folder in this device. Again a disappointment for me and as before no confirmation from customer care about future update.
- Call recording options- In what seems to be a bizzare setting, the recording is split into two - one to record all calls from numbers not in your contact list and the other for Selected numbers which would require you to start adding all your contacts one by one painfully. There is no simple option to record all calls. For someone with maybe 200 or more contacts it is a hard day's work. You have to click Choose contact and from the next screen of all listed contacts, select a contact which takes you back to the previous screen. You have to again click Choose contact to select your next contact. Very tiring and cumbersome and I am not sure why Realme had to complicate this simple option into something so confounding. Real disappointment for me there.

Keeping these three issues aside, I loved this phone every bit. I have to say that this device at 8999 outperforms my 15000 Samsung in every aspect.

I only hope they will take care of the missing or convoluted basic feature issues that I mentioned before to make this phone a true super hero!.

Honest review and pros and cons,,"Here is my honest review of the realme narzo N53 smartphone:

Pros:

Fast charging - The 33W fast charging allows the phone's 5,000 mAh battery to charge very quickly. realme claims it can charge to 50% in just 28 minutes.
Slim design - At 7.99mm thick, realme says this is the slimmest phone in its price segment. The featherweight design makes it comfortable to hold.
90Hz display - The 6.6"" FHD+ display has a 90Hz refresh rate for smooth scrolling and transitions. Good for gaming and multimedia.
Decent hardware - It has a MediaTek Helio G85 processor, up to 6GB RAM and 128GB storage which is decent hardware for the price. Gaming performance should be smooth.
Cons:

Average camera - The 50MP main camera is decent but night photography and low light shots may not be great. Lacks high-end camera features like OIS.
Older software - Ships with Android 11, not the latest Android 12. Support for software updates is unclear.
Plastic build - The featherlight design is thanks to a plastic body rather than glass or metal. It doesn't feel very premium.
Overall, the narzo N53 offers good fast charging, a slim and light design, smooth 90Hz display and decent performance for the price. But the cameras, software and build quality could be better. For budget smartphone buyers who prioritize fast charging and design, it's worth considering. But those wanting the best camera or software may want to look at other options.

Best Phone,,"Camera quality is good, Battery life is perfect, take half an hour to full charge. Over all performance of this phone is very good."
Good according the price range,,The mobile is good according the price range. The camera is good according to the price. In starting battery back up is arround 1-2 days but after some time the battery back up will be maximum 1 day. The charging is fast 33W charger. Overall The mobile is good according to the price range but if you do gaming mobile will start getting little heat and the game will not run smoothly so the mobile is not for heavy games but small games can run easily and the other things are also good so for the normal work mobile is good according to the price range.
Can't expect more,,Teams won't work. If you are a tech freak don't buy this. Camera quality low. But if you want only battery life you can buy.

Average camera - The 50MP main camera is decent but night photography and low light shots may not be great. Lacks high-end camera features like OIS.
Older software - Ships with Android 11, not the latest Android 12. Support for software updates is unclear.
Plastic build - The featherlight design is thanks to a plastic body rather than glass or metal. It doesn't feel very premium.
Overall, the narzo N53 offers good fast charging, a slim and light design, smooth 90Hz display and decent performance for the price. But the cameras, software and build quality could be better. For budget smartphone buyers who prioritize fast charging and design, it's worth considering. But those wanting the best camera or software may want to look at other options.

Best Phone,,"Camera quality is good, Battery life is perfect, take half an hour to full charge. Over all performance of this phone is very good."
Good according the price range,,The mobile is good according the price range. The camera is good according to the price. In starting battery back up is arround 1-2 days but after some time the battery back up will be maximum 1 day. The charging is fast 33W charger. Overall The mobile is good according to the price range but if you do gaming mobile will start getting little heat and the game will not run smoothly so the mobile is not for heavy games but small games can run easily and the other things are also good so for the normal work mobile is good according to the price range.
Can't expect more,,Teams won't work. If you are a tech freak don't buy this. Camera quality low. But if you want only battery life you can buy.
Good Quality,,"Budget friendly fully loaded features with latest features Ã§amera quality and look good.
Good to buy if looking Budget friendly mobile."
Excellent performance*****,,"I ordered this cellphone phone, 1st I feel yes we got good quality of product ðŸ’¯% value for money..
Excellent performance"
"Good product, nice and sleek",,"Nice phone, value for money"
Love the phone but missing couple of basic feature options,,"For the price of 8999 this is truly an amazing phone in terms of performance, smoothness weight and comfortability to use. I exchanged this with a Redmi 9A and compared to that this device is 100 times better.
The camera is amazing, battery backup is fantastic and charging is super fast. There are no lags when switching apps and there are many useful features which are seen in Moto phones that I could find on this device.

Having said that I was surprised to find some basic features missing or complicated compared to Samsung or Redmi phones.
- There is no option to Hide Apps. No App Lock or any such option to hide the many apps which you may not use. The UI version is T edition and that is not even mentioned on the website. The previous UI versions and the option to enable Hide Apps or Lock Apps is listed on Realme website. I use the feature of Hide Apps on all my phones and so it was a disappointment here. Call to customer care did not get a confirmation if that will be available in future updates.
- There is no option to create folder or group icons together. In all my other phones I have this option and even on the cheaper that Realme ones. For example all your UPI apps will be mixed up all over the app drawer and cannot be grouped under a single folder in this device. Again a disappointment for me and as before no confirmation from customer care about future update.
- Call recording options- In what seems to be a bizzare setting, the recording is split into two - one to record all calls from numbers not in your contact list and the other for Selected numbers which would require you to start adding all your contacts one by one painfully. There is no simple option to record all calls. For someone with maybe 200 or more contacts it is a hard day's work. You have to click Choose contact and from the next screen of all listed contacts, select a contact which takes you back to the previous screen. You have to again click Choose contact to select your next contact. Very tiring and cumbersome and I am not sure why Realme had to complicate this simple option into something so confounding. Real disappointment for me there.

Keeping these three issues aside, I loved this phone every bit. I have to say that this device at 8999 outperforms my 15000 Samsung in every aspect.

I only hope they will take care of the missing or convoluted basic feature issues that I mentioned before to make this phone a true super hero!.
